### Executive Summary

### Python IDLE
#### Explain the difference between the shell and file editor in the IDLE 

In Python, Shell is used for interpreting. It is an interactive platform where the three triangles are the primary tool. In this platform, we can have tests of small programs. Instead, IDE is a more complex platform where developers can do editing of multiple source code files, code syntax highlighting; access change control; scrubbers; compilers; deep search tools, and code refactoring tools.
