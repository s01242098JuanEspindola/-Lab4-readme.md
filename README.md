### Executive Summary

### Python IDLE
#### Explain the difference between the shell and file editor in the IDLE 

In Python, Shell is used for interpreting. It is an interactive platform where the three triangles are the primary tool. In this platform, we can have tests of small programs. Instead, IDE is a more complex platform where developers can do editing of multiple source code files, code syntax highlighting; access change control; scrubbers; compilers; deep search tools, and code refactoring tools.


 ### Code Examples 
 
A variable is a way to store any value. This is important because we will need any value again in the future. For example, a variable is like a box where we can store any value, word, or name. A variable is relevant because, in any program, we need two or more variables to realize any instruction.

### Assignment Statements:

In python, we can use any name to file the number, name, or info we need in another program.  For example, We need to store 33 as a value. Then, we assigned a name to 33 as spam called a variable. After that, we created a new variable called bacon and assigned the value 27. When we have bacon and spam.We ask the next instruction spam + bacon = 40. Adionately, we can to assign new value that will subtitute for a new number or word


### The print() Function

For a beginner in python, the print() function shows any value inside the parentheses in the display. The message could be a chain, word, or number that will be converter into the screen.For example when one print line we write (Hello world!) . This is means print the text in the string. When Python We use the word print, the name of the function, and then in parentheses, we provide an argument—in this case, what we want printed—that the print() function is expecting.

integers, floating-point numbers, and strings

integers – This value is represented by int class. It contains positive or negative whole numbers (without fraction or decimal).  For example when use print(+ number)

Tfloating-point numbersh is value is represented by float class. It is a real number with floating point representation. For example when use print(+ hello word)

. A string is a collection of one or more characters put in a single quote, double-quote or triple quote.

### Graphics

### Raster vs. Vector Graphics

Graphics rasters are built from pixels, the tiny color square that all united form high-quality images. For example, we can see distortion when we apply zoom to a picture. The most common are the photos that file as JPG, GIF, PNG, TIF, BMP, and PSD


Vector graphics are distinct from a raster. Vector is made by e mathematical equations, lines, and curves with fixed points on a grid to produce an image. The advantage of the vector is made high or smaller. They do not lose quantity. For example, professionals build vector images for mathematical equations, lines, and curves. When we apply zoom to an image, we cannot see distortion.

#### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression 

Choosing a format for each image is essential. There are different types of formats, such as JPG, GIF, and PNG. Depending on the kind of image, developers can use different types of formats. This can vary from the need of the person or the developer. For example, the most appropriate format is GIF for graphics or images such as logos or drawings. Because a large number of color palettes are used, on the other hand, it is better to use JPGE for photos or with degraded images because the pictures have subtle color changes and show better quality when saved. The best option for images with high contrast is PNG, because they do not lose the original quality.
