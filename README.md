### Executive Summary

### Python IDLE
#### Explain the difference between the shell and file editor in the IDLE 

In Python, Shell is used for interpreting. It is an interactive platform where the three triangles are the primary tool. In this platform, we can have tests of small programs. Instead, IDE is a more complex platform where developers can do editing of multiple source code files, code syntax highlighting; access change control; scrubbers; compilers; deep search tools, and code refactoring tools.


 ### Code Examples 
 
A variable is a way to store any value. This is important because we will need any value again in the future. For example, a variable is like a box where we can store any value, word, or name. A variable is relevant because, in any program, we need two or more variables to realize any instruction.

### Assignment Statements:

In python, we can use any name to file the number, name, or info we need in another program.  For example, We need to store 33 as a value. Then, we assigned a name to 33 as spam called a variable. After that, we created a new variable called bacon and assigned the value 27. When we have bacon and spam.We ask the next instruction spam + bacon = 40. Adionately, we can to assign new value that will subtitute for a new number or word


### The print() Function

For a beginner in python, the print() function shows any value inside the parentheses in the display. The message could be a chain, word, or number that will be converter into the screen.For example when one print line we write (Hello world!) . This is means print the text in the string. When Python We use the word print, the name of the function, and then in parentheses, we provide an argument—in this case, what we want printed—that the print() function is expecting.

integers, floating-point numbers, and strings

integers – This value is represented by int class. It contains positive or negative whole numbers (without fraction or decimal).  For example when use print(+ number)

Tfloating-point numbersh is value is represented by float class. It is a real number with floating point representation. For example when use print(+ hello word)

. A string is a collection of one or more characters put in a single quote, double-quote or triple quote.
